		- using '__' instead of '$_' for class names
		- using 'import' instead of 'include' for double include guard (makes NSString_stub.m compile)
		- don't output $class__alloc on NSObject, since NSObject already has a class method alloc

	* genstubs.pl (parseMethod):
	- noted why we are not supporting methods variable args
	- moved declaration of $methodName to where it is first used
	- updated $arg_rx to make argument name optional
	- reformatted Urs' $argType and $argName definition
	- changed the way the $methodName is assembled
	- changed the NSLog() call based on what type of method this is
